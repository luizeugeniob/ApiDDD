# API Project in Domain Driven Design

This is a project that exemplifies an API using ASP.NET Core 3.1, using DDD (Domain Driven Design) architecture. 

Entity Framework Core is used as ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to manipulate the database. SQL Server was used as a standard database, but it also has the packages to connect the project with MySQL. 

Swagger was used as an interface, and AutoMapper and JWT (Jason Web Token) were also applied to this project.
